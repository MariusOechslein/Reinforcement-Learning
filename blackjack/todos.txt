### Todo's
[ ] - Train it once really long to get to the optimal policy (making sure that Monte Carlo is the right approach)
[X] - Understand the environment + Understand the code
[ ] - (Make it work locally on the macbook?)
[ ] - Recreate the environment myself to be able to add/ change rules -> Also achieve optimal policy
[ ] - Achieve the Complete Point-Count System by changing some things about the environment (like keeping track of a stack instead of sampling cards randomly. Also to add another dimension to the state which counts the cards. Also count the additional dimension based on the value of the cards.)
[ ] - Send it to the group
[ ] - Do the printing functions myself/ a little bit different
[ ] - Do some changes to the rules
[ ] - Write paper
